Stuck in a maze
Everything's okay but it's not really okay
My life's a death race
I'm numbing my pain with codeine rain
I'm going insane
Life's not the same
Stuck in a maze
I'm not going in
My brain is going everywhere
I'm tormented every day
Mama, I'm losing my mental
The sorrows I've been through
